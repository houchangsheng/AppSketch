.TH LPI_PROTOIDENT "1" "April 2019" "libprotoident" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
lpi_protoident \- list the application protocol of all network flows in a trace
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lpi_protoident
inputuri

.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool attempts to identify each individual flow within the provided
network packet trace, along with the application protocol that is being used by 
it, using the libprotoident traffic classification library.
Identification only occurs when the flow has concluded or expired due
to inactivity, so it is not very effective for real-time use cases.
.PP
The \fBinputuri\fR argument must be a valid libtrace URI.

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
For each flow discovered in the input trace, a single line is printed to
stdout describing the flow. The line contains the following whitespace
separated field (in order):

.nf
* Application protocol (as reported by libprotoident)
* IP address of the first endpoint
* IP address of the second endpoint
* Port used by the first endpoint
* Port used by the second endpoint
* Transport protocol (6 = TCP, 17 = UDP)
* Unix timestamp when the flow began
* Unix timestamp when the flow ended
* Total bytes sent from first endpoint to second endpoint
* Total bytes sent from second endpoint to first endpoint
* First four bytes of payload sent from first endpoint (in hex)
* First four bytes of payload sent from first endpoint (ASCII)
* Size of first payload-bearing packet sent from first endpoint
* First four bytes of payload sent from second endpoint (in hex)
* First four bytes of payload sent from second endpoint (ASCII)
* Size of first payload-bearing packet sent from second endpoint
